        <h3>The problem that my project aims to solve:</h3>
I’m trying to solve the problem where high school students cannot find peers who share the same background/experience as they do to talk to.

            <h3>How I discovered this problem: </h3>
I hoped to create value for high school students with mental health problems and I discovered the problem by interviewing these students/their friends and many of them reflect that they would prefer to talk to someone whom they can relate to rather than school counselors/therapists.

            <h3>A story about my intervirewee's experience of the problem:</h3>
  One of my interviewees was from Vietnam, and she complains that talking to her therapist, who is a white person, regarding childhood traumas caused by unpleasant experiences in a traditional Vietnamese school and racial problems have been especially challenging; “My therapist is a nice person and she tried to help. But when it came to my experiences back in Vietnam there’s a lot that she couldn’t understand and relate to.”
	 	 	 		
            <h3>Why this problem is meaningful to me: </h3>
 I have struggled with mental health problems and I believe that it is crucial for one to talk to the right person because I think dealing with traumas are about speaking to someone who would understand.
            
            <h3>My solution and how it works:</h3>
I’m planning to create a website for high school students and school counselors. The website will pair students up with peers whom share the same struggle/experiences as they do and allow counselors to make recommendations regarding whom students might be interested in talking to. Below is a screenshot of the website prototype:<br><br><br>

              <br><br><br>
            <h3>The process I went through and the experiments, pilots, and prototypes I ran when developing my idea: </h3>
I paired students who share the same experience up to have one on one conversations. I was trying to learn if students are really interested in talking to their peers instead of school counselors and if the conversations are effective. I’ve got positive feedbacks regarding talking to peers rather than counselor and negative ones regarding the effectiveness of the conversation. I learned that in order to make the conversations effective, one of the peers must have more experience regarding a specific topic than the other one.	

            <h3>Some challenges I faced and how I overcome them:</h3>	
I had a hard time trying to find cold contact and pair them up with peers because it does require some time devotion and follow up interviews. I overcame this challenge by contacting more people and also sending out follow up emails if any of them did not respond.<br><br><br>

            <h3>Next for my venture:</h3>
I’m hoping to offer this idea to counselors at other schools as I’m getting positive responses from students.		
		
            <h3>Some things that I learned from this process that will benefit me in future endeavors:</h3>
I learned that no matter how hard something might look like, there’s always ways to accomplish it when we break things into smaller steps and it’s never too early or too late to start doing something.
	
            <h3>Further possible work on my project:</h3> 
According to the tests I have run, I think helping students to have one on one conversations through school counselors is effective. My next step would be to build a website for students and peer counselors so that students can talk to more peers instead of the only few recommended by school counselors. 

            <h3>How I imagine my project scaling beyond the pilots or prototypes that I have created so far: 	</h3>	
 If I’m successful in completing the website, I would be able to reach to high school students located in the United States in general instead of a few high schools.

            <h3>What I took away from this experience: </h3>
 One of my takeaways is that it is crucial to find out what people really need in order to create the right value for them. Without interviewing dozens of students and professionals, I could have set my topic on food safety, which is a less urgent problem for high school students.

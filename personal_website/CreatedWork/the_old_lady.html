            <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Old Lady</h1><br>
            <p>Yesterday afternoon, my friend Joe came to my house. We played poker and had nice cups of chrysanthemum tea and a few newly-baked butter cookies, while outside there was a late summer rain, reminding people of the arrival of autumn with chilly breezes. The stake of the game was a good story. I won, and he lost.<br>
    So the next day, he came back with an interesting story.</p>

    <p>A few years ago on my brother’s death anniversary, I went to visit him. It was a cloudy summer day, the sweltering heat in the wet air crawling onto every inch of people’s skin, making them easily out of breath. I brought him several white roses-they were a little withered and had several yellow spots near the edges of the petals, but those roses were the best flowers I could buy with two pieces of crumpled one-dollar paper money. Like the previous years, I sat in front of his gray tombstone and placed the flowers, paler under the thick clouds, right under his name.</p>
    <p>It was then that I noticed this middle-aged lady, whom I saw a few times here before, tottered to a tombstone a few meters away. Her disheveled brown hair mixing with streaks of grey, while seemed to haven’t combed for days, swang down her back. Even at some distance, I could see her deep crow’s feet. They were marks left by the knife of rough experiences, once carved on cannot be removed. </p>
    <p>She hunkered down slowly in front of the tombstone, frowning hard that it formed more deep wrinkles on her gaunt face.  She fumbled in both of her pockets and took out several pieces of sweets in colorful wrapping paper, which seemed garish in a surrounding dominated by gray matters. </p>
<br>
    <p>Then all her motions came to a pause. </p>

    <p>She sat quietly on the warm, moist soil baked by the heat of summer, holding the candies and chocolates in her cupped hands. She lowered her head and concealed her face in the shadow of the tombstone.</p> 
    <p>She was silent for quite a while in the cemetery, where grief sucked up the concept of time, confining lamenters in the golden, glorious, dusty cage of the Past and drowning them in deep memories.</p>

<p>“Hi Monkey, mama brought you your favorite candies.” At the instance that she began to talk, a warm smile forced out the frowns and smoothed the wrinkles. 
    Then she carefully put down the candies one by one, whispering to her child the flavors and brands. </p>
    <p>“Monkey, these are Laffy Taffy candies,” she brought the little piece of pink hard candy closer to her eyes and squinted to see the tiny words printed on it, “it’s the cantaloupe flavor, your favorite.”</p>
    <p>The warm smile did not fade away as I stared at her. If not because the glints on her cheeks were too obvious, who would ever notice that tears were quietly flowing out of her cloudy eyes and dripping down into the black soil?</p>

    <p>She and I both didn’t know that down there in the little coffin, the wrecked small body parts were sewed up the same way as a cheap doll and bundled into a delicate, fragile white dress. Her eyes and lips were sewed by the undertaker, so she does not display a fierce face and scare off the mourners during the funeral. And after all these years, time had slowly consumed her watery eyes, cherry-colored lips, red flesh, down to the pale bones, until there’s nothing left but a wisp of dust.</p>

    <p>“It was then that I saw this stout, raunchy man, wrapped in a crumpled suit, walked straight toward the lady.” Joe paused a bit, sighed. I saw something flitted across his dark pupils at the same moment, a grain of shame, perhaps. I couldn’t be sure as the late summer heat, while clinging to my skin, forming a thin mist, swirling slowly in the room and rippling as Joe’s voice bouncing against the walls. </p>
    <p>“Continue, please.” </p>

    <p>He then stopped behind her, grasping her by the collar, and forced her to stagger to her feet. He was sideways to me, stoop-shouldered, bundling one hand into a small pocket of his suit. Strands of dirty gray hair fell over his angular face, covering the expression on it. </p>
    <p>She raised her head slightly, stared at the man in front of her, pushing and tearing his pale collars desperately with her weak arms and bony hands. Tears filled up her eyes quickly, like the fear and disgust she had toward him, streaming down her cheeks uncontrollably.</p>
    <p>“Don’t touch me… Let me go, let me go please… ”She begged, shaking her head, her hoarse voice echoed in the cemetery, waking several mourning souls from sorrow and sweet memories. </p>

    <p>Their heads turned around, the hollow eyes embedded on pale faces watching him and her secretly among the tombstones.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, huh? ” He yelled, his spittle splashing in her face. 
<p>“What are you f**king doing here? You are NOT ALLOWED to come here, you understand? Now, now you’re my wife, so you don’t see this little b**ch you had with, with that bastard, you understand? You long hair, short-sighted woman!” 
<p>He then trampled on the colorful candies in front of the tombstone, crushing the hard ones wrapped in delicate packages, and the only two pieces of heart-shaped milk chocolate, like paste, stuck the wrapping paper to the black soles of the dusty leather shoes.

<p>The lady, who had been crying hopelessly, suddenly struggled madly as if she could stand his words no more.
“How dare you, how dare you to speak of my daughter like that! HOW DARE YOU!” She screamed.
He then slapped her hard.
She fell to the ground.

<p>“Then he suddenly turned his head toward me. The… the first thing that I noticed was the eyes. They were just like the eyes of wild animals, barbaric, and irrational. Those blood vessels clung on the eyeballs like… like snakes. Those eyes were chasing me, and for many days the image flowed in my head every single time I closed my eyes.” Joe said and took a deep breath, “I think he was on drugs.”

<p>Then I ran away. Behind me, I could still hear him swearing and a woman crying and screaming.
<p>I ran till the voices were too far to hear.

<p>A few months later, when I went to visit my brother again, I asked one of the cleaners of the cemetery about the lady.
<p>“The one who always brought candies? Yes, I remember her. Poor woman. Her daughter passed away in a car crash, and she had been coming here several times a month for the past ten years, and a few months ago she suddenly stopped coming.”

<p>It’s still raining outside, and I asked Joe: “That’s it?”
<p>“That’s it.”
<p>“You regret not stopping him from abusing her. Why do you choose to tell me this story?”
<p>“Things you don’t talk about getting heavier over time.”
<p>“You didn’t do anything wrong.”
<p>“Why?”
<p>"...I don't know. I just don't think so."

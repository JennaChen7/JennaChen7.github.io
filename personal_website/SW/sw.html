            <p> During my freshman year, I participated in the SW event held in Shenzhen. It is a weekend event of starting up a business, including creating a business plan and product prototype. </p>
            <p>The theme of the event was sustainability, which encouraged the participants to create an environmentally harmless business.</p> <br>

            <p><b style="font-size: 26px;">-What did our team come up with?-</b><br><br>
    We first realized that one of the main reasons why people fail to quit smoking is that they lack the frequent encouragement of people close to them. Nowadays, people are typically busy and have less time to spend with family members. So, we decided to create an app to enable family members or friends to encourage smokers to cease smoking. First, after the registration of both family members and smokers, a plan will be provided to the smokers to help them quit smoking gradually, while family members would be able to track their progress and provide them with a reward after they complete a certain stage. The reward will be purchased through the app, which is how we planned to benefit.
            </p>
           <p style="font-size: 26px;">Afterward, I realized that helping people quit smoking is not a sustainability project, but I deferred to my teammates. My original idea was to make edible chopsticks, spoons, and forks to reduce plastic wastes.</p><br>

            <p><b style="font-size: 26px;">-What did I work on?-</b><br><br>
After a discussion on Friday night, the team had tasks distributed to every member. I constructed a survey regarding smokers' age, what kind of rewards they would like to receive, and will people who wish someone to quit smoking be willing to use an app to track the progress. I also helped write part of the ppt for the final presentation.</p><br>

            <p>I participated in another Startup Weekend event with a different theme again during the summer of 2020. Over this weekend, our team came up with a business plan along with a website prototype which I built, aiming at helping undergraduate and graduate students find internships. Specifically, the website recommended several internships according to the users' major, schedule, location, etc. In addition, the website helped the users contact companies, hand in applications, and set up interviews. Because this is business plan that solves a real problem with a practical method, our team came in the third place this time.</p>

            <p><b style="font-size: 26px;">-Why did I choose to participate in this specific event?-</b><br><br>
I have always had a strong interest in environmental protection and sustainability.<br>
                I created a video on it:</p>

            <video id="ep" width="700" controls>

  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">

            </video>
            
            <p>I created a video explaining the details of what I did the second time I participated in Startup Weekend Event:</p><br>

        var mainVideo = $('#ep');

if ($(window).width() < 1200 && medQualVersion) {
  mainVideo.append("<source type='video/mp4' src='" + medQualVersionSrc + "' />");
} else {
  mainVideo.append("<source type='video/mp4' src='" + highQualVersionSrc + "' />");
}
mainVideo.append("<source type='video/webm' src='" + webMSrc + "' />");

// Wait until sources are appended to call MediaElements.js
mainVideo.mediaelementplayer();

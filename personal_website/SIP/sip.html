            <p>The Social Innovators Program is a <a href=" https://www.schoolyardventures.com/" target="_blank">twelve-week program offered by SBS, UPenn, and Schoolyard Ventures</a>. It is designed to help students develop a social idea into a functioning organization, during which I drafted a plan and a website prototype to help students who are struggling connect with therapists. </p>

        <h3>The problem that my project aims to solve:</h3>
I’m trying to solve the problem where high school students cannot find peers who share the same background/experience as they do to talk to.

            <h3>How I discovered this problem: </h3>
I hoped to create value for high school students with mental health problems. I discovered the problem by interviewing these students/their friends. Many of them reflected that they would prefer to talk to someone whom they can relate to rather than school counselors/therapists.

            <h3>A story about my interviewee's experience of the problem:</h3>
 One of my interviewees was from Vietnam. Her therapist was a white person, and when she talked about racial problems or her childhood traumas caused by unpleasant experience at a traditional Vietnamese school, her therapist could not relate. She said: “My therapist is a nice person and she tried to help. But when it came to my experiences back in Vietnam there’s a lot that she couldn’t understand and relate to.”

	 	 	 		
            <h3>Why this problem is meaningful to me: </h3>
Personally, I have struggled with mental health problems myself and I believe that it is crucial for one to talk to the right person. I think dealing with traumas are about speaking to someone who could understand what you’re going through.

            <h3>My solution and how it works:</h3>
I’m planning to create a website for high school students and school counselors. The website will pair up students with peers who share the same struggle/experiences. It will also allow counselors to make recommendations regarding whom students might be interested in talking to.
Below is a screenshot of the website prototype:<br><br><br>

            <h3>The process I went through and the experiments, pilots, and prototypes I ran when developing my idea: </h3>
I paired up students who share the same experience to have one on one conversations. I was trying to learn if students are really interested in talking to their peers instead of school counselors, as well as if the conversations are effective. I’ve got positive feedbacks regarding talking to peers rather than counselor and negative ones regarding the effectiveness of the conversation. I learned that in order to make the conversations effective, one of the peers must have more experience than the other one on a specific topic.

            <h3>Some challenges I faced and how I overcome them:</h3>	
I had a hard time trying to find cold contact and pair them up with peers because it does require some time devotion and follow up interviews. I overcame this challenge by contacting more people and also sending out follow up emails in case any of them did not respond.

            <h3>Next for my venture:</h3>
I’m hoping to introduce this idea to counselors at other schools as I gained positive responses from students.			
		
            <h3>Some things that I learned from this process that will benefit me in future endeavors:</h3>
I learned that no matter how hard something might look like, there’re always ways to accomplish it when we break things into smaller steps and it’s never too early or too late to start doing something.

	
            <h3>Further possible work on my project:</h3> 
According to the tests I have run, I think helping students to have one on one conversations through school counselors is effective. My next step is to build a website for students and peer counselors. Then, students can talk to more peers instead of the only few recommended by school counselors. 


            <h3>How I imagine my project scaling beyond the pilots or prototypes that I have created so far: 	</h3>	
 If I’m successful in completing the website, I would be able to make it accessible for all high school students located in the United States.


            <h3>What I took away from this experience: </h3>
 One of my takeaways is that it is crucial to find out what people really need in order to create the right value for them. Without interviewing dozens of students and professionals, I could have set my topic on food safety, which is a less urgent problem for high school students.

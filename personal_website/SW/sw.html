            <p> During my freshman year, I participated in the SW event held in Shenzhen. It is a weekend event of starting up a business, including creating a business plan and product prototype. </p>
            <p>The theme of the event was sustainability, which encouraged the participants to create a business that is environmentally harmless.</p> <br>

            <p><b style="font-size: 26px;">-What did our team come up with?-</b><br><br>
    We first realized that one of the main reasons why people fail to quit smoking is that they lack the frequent encouragement of people close to them. Nowadays, people are typically busy and have less time to spend on family members. So, we decided to create an app to enable family members or friends to encourage smokers to cease smoking. First, after the registration of both family members and smokers, a plan will be provided to the smokers to help them quit smoking gradually, while family members would be able to track their progress and provide them with a reward after they completed a certain stage. The reward will be purchased through the app, which is how we planned to benefit.</p><br>

            <p><b style="font-size: 26px;">-What did I work on?-</b><br><br>
After a discussion on Friday night, the team had tasks distributed to every member. I constructed a survey regarding smokerâ€™s age, what kind of rewards they would like to receive, and will people who wish someone to quit smoking be willing to use an app to track the progress. I also helped write part of the ppt for the final presentation.<br>
Unfortunately, I missed the chance of presenting because I had to leave earlier for a flight.</p><br>

            <p><b style="font-size: 26px;">-Why did I choose to participate in this specific event?-</b><br><br>
I always have a strong interest in environmental protection, and sustainability is the key to solve this problem.<br>
                I created a video on it:</p>
 </div>
        
        
        
            <video id="ep" width="700" controls>
<source src="videos/environment_problem.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">

            </video>
            
            <p>I participated in the SW event again during my sophomore year, and I created a video for it:</p><br>
            <video width="700" controls>
  <source src="videos/sw_video.mp4" type="video/mp4">

        <script>
        var mainVideo = $('#ep');

if ($(window).width() < 1200 && medQualVersion) {
  mainVideo.append("<source type='video/mp4' src='" + medQualVersionSrc + "' />");
} else {
  mainVideo.append("<source type='video/mp4' src='" + highQualVersionSrc + "' />");
}
mainVideo.append("<source type='video/webm' src='" + webMSrc + "' />");

// Wait until sources are appended to call MediaElements.js
mainVideo.mediaelementplayer();
